# The Limited - club
## Developed for Ludum Dare 54
This is a short story of a person who is going to the club having a good time.

What will happen? What will you discover? It is up to you to play and find out!

There is minigames where you need quick reflexes. Otherwise it's a story driven game. Have fun!
